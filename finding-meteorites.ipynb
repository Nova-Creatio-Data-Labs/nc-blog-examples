    "The pattern of \"years\" shows clear maximums atoudn 1940 and 1970. This is curious -- either meteorite hunters got very interested in these years, or perhaps the data was most redily aggregated then. Still, it does not affect our analysis at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median mass of the meteors found is 1.7 kg - that's big! But unsurprising, since it's more likely to find big ones. The largest one is 30,000 kg - that is remarkable. Below, I extract data on meteorites over 1,000 kg (1 ton). These are mostly famous meteorites; for example, the \"Canyon Diablo\" meteorite refers to a meteorite which fell 50,000 years ago in Arizona. This is the largest meteorite in the dataset, 30 tons. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only meteorite of this size marked as \"fell\" is the Norton County meteorite - the rest were \"found\". This meteorite has its own (Wikipedia) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_County_(meteorite)] page:\n",

    ">After a brilliant fireball and a loud noise, a very large shower of meteorites fell over a large area of Norton County (Kansas) and Furnas County (Nebraska) on February 18, 1948. \n",
    ">The main mass (about 1,070 kilograms (2,360 lb)) is the center piece of the meteorite display at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all very interesting, but it does not in the end affect our analysis that much -- except perhaps to tell us that we are most likely to find larger meteorites, not because they are more common, but because they are easier to find. "

    "\n",
    "* The dataset includes meteorites which were found - and the year corresponds to when they were found, or when they were seen falling.\n",
    "* The dataset is biased towards meteorites which are easier to find; large, and located in arid regions without heavy tree cover.\n",
    "* There are unexplained peaks and valleys in the years of meteorite finds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Revise Goal, if you Need to\n",
    "Your exploration may have introduced limitations, or pointed out curious features to you, that may prompt you to revise your initial goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, my initial goal was to find the place in the USA I could most readily find meteorites. Nothing in my analysis thus far prompts me to need to revise that goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Define Analysis Objective\n",
    "Now set with a set of clean data about which you understand very well, you are not ready to go beyond your vague goall and define your actual analysis parameters. Carefully specify in detail what you want to analyze, and your key questions to be answered. This should be detailed enough that you can readily complete an analysis, and should include any key limitations or assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, I will use the following analysis objective:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Meteorite landings should fall evenly across the surface of the Earth; every square mile of the continental USA should therefore have about the same number of fallen meteorites. But this density does not mean they are all equally easy to find; arid regions without tree cover, especially *bona fide* deserts, will present the best opportunity for finding meteorites, since there is little or no vegetative cover to obscure them. It should also be assumed that nowhere near all meteorites have been found, since so many fall constantly upon the Earth, and that even in regions where many have been taken, the total number is basically unchanged. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Therefore, with these assumptions, I will identify the areas of the continental USA where meteorites are most likely to be found as those with the *highest* density of meteorites which have been found. I will analyze this per US state.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this analyze objective in hand, complete your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Complete Analysis\n",
    "Now take whatever analysis steps you need to, to finish your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we will evalute the relative spatial density of meteorite strikes per US State; the state with the highest density is where we should look for meteorites. \n"
